This project is a scientific calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to perform both basic and advanced calculations with ease. The calculator offers the following features:

Basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan, and their inverses) for angle-based calculations.
Logarithmic and exponential functions to handle more complex math.
Power and root calculations, allowing for flexible mathematical operations.
Clear and responsive user interface, making it simple to navigate on both desktop and mobile devices.
Error handling and result formatting for a smooth user experience.
This project not only demonstrates my proficiency in web development but also highlights my ability to work with JavaScript logic to create dynamic, interactive elements. The styling in CSS ensures that the layout is visually appealing and responsive across various screen sizes.
